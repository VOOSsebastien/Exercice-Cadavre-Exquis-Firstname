## *Our story begins during a particularly hot summer somewhere far far away.*

In the old days and during this season you could enjoyed the laughts of children playing in swimming pools and gardens, meeting around the sports grounds or simply the presence of almost the entire village in the usually peaceful streets of this sweet hamlet of Everwinter .

Unfortunately, a natural disaster meant that winter 20 years ago never really gave way to spring, then to summer.
The temperatures were around -15Â° for 15 years, so the parents no longer wanted to let the children out because they were afraid that he would freeze to death.
